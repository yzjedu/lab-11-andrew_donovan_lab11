# Algorithm Document

#### THINK before you code...
#### Write down the list of tasks to help you think
#### Full algorithm is not required
# Tasks:
- Ask user for file name

- Read file and put into a list

- Read file into a dictionary/ copy and paste if can't figure out

- Use the values of the list as a key for the dictionary and set it into another list

- Write new list onto a new file
