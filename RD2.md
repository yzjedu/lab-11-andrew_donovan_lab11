In this lab my partner and I were supposed to practice with files, creating functions, testing code, error checking, and utilizing the many other aspects of Python we've learned so far.

Using what the class has learned from previous lectures, Donovan and I followed the design process/steps in first understanding the readme in its full, developing an algorithm, peer reviewing those, test cases, and then developing our code. We used each other as peer reviewers as a technique to solve any difficulties we had or errors. Key concepts explored were writing functions, lists, files, loops, Booleans, as well as error checking.

Our groups results did match what we expected. Because we designed our program through our algorithm, it was easier to do our code and get the results we expected. Our group also developed multiple test cases, which helped us make sure our code worked well.

The challenges we encountered were finding a place to start and communication. We had to make sure we communicated together. I think my key takeaways from this lab was using files and accessing them and editing them, creating functions, incorporating lists and error checking, and how they can help take your code to the next level and help out a lot. I do believe our group ended up learning what we were supposed to from this lab. It was nice working with Donovan that way we could split the workload and give each other ideas.
